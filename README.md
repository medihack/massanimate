# Fanimate - is Fast Animate

## About

jQuery Fanimate is a tiny (~100 lines) but very powerful jQuery extension.
It allows to animate hundreds of elements at once by using stylesheet rules
(instead of animating each element style like jQuery does).

[**Demo**](http://medihack.github.com/jquery-fanimate/demo.html)

## Dependencies

Tested with jQuery 1.5.1, but it should work with jQuery >= 1.4.3

## Usage

Simply add a class (e.g. "fanimate") to all elements you would like to animate (this is usually pretty fast).
Then use Fanimate like below:

    $.fanimate("div.fanimate") // creates a new empty style rule
	.css({width: 50, height: 50, opacity: 0}) // set some initial style attributes
	.animate({width: 100, height: 100, opacity: 1}, 2000) // animate those attributes
	.animate({width: 50, height: 50, opacity: 0}, 2000, function() { // another animation
		// do something afterwards
	})
	.remove(); // remove the added style rule and all its style attributes

I hardly recommend setting the initial style attributes with the `css` method that you want to animate. You can also
set the styles using `css` between the `animate` methods.

`remove` deletes the rule after all animations are finished. After that you can't add new animations to that rule. The
`remove` is fully optional. You can also use Fanimate to just set styles without any animations.

Keep in mind that Fanimate can't animate already set element styles. This is because Fanimate uses normal style
sheet definitions which can never override element styles.

Thanks to David Tang and his very nice Javascript Stylesheet rule library [JSS](https://github.com/Box9/jss).
Fanimate reuses some of his code to setup the CSS rules.
